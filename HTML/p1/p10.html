====================== THEORY =======================

1. In the description, we hinted that some features were similar to
existing features. In particular, "defquery" and "infer" share a
similarity with another pair of features, particularly in the way they
handle environments and delayed evaluation.  Explain which features
these are and what the similarity is.

2. Suppose instead of (interp), we had a function with the following signature:
;;interp-with-sampler: (SOMETHING) RSE? -> RSE-Value?
(define (interp-with-sampler sample-from-dist expr) ...)

That is, suppose we allowed someone calling this
function to interpret an expression, using
their own random number generator for "sample"
expressions.

What signature would we use in place of (SOMETHING)?
That is, what should the inputs and outputs of the
"sample-from-dist" function be?

3. In assignment 2, to add two distributions,
we looked at all combinations of values from the two.
This feature was removed in this assignment.
Given distributions D1 and D2, how could we
approximate {+ D1 D2} in our language,
using sample, defquery, and infer?
